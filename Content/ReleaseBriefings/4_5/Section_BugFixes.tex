\begin{frame}[fragile]{Bug Fixes (1/3)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fix storage lifetime of driver for global launch of graph nodes for CUDA and HIP
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item Previously, graph nodes were not stored by the graph itself
      \item Undefined behavior for all future graph submit when a node goes out of scope
    \end{itemize}
    \item Fix \texttt{TeamPolicy} array reduction for CUDA and HIP
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item[] Previously, array reductions did not compile
    \end{itemize}
    \item Fix potential out of bounds view access in \texttt{Kokkos::BinSort} with \texttt{Serial} host backend
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Bug Fixes (2/3)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fix for \texttt{deep\_copy(exec, ...)} in case where multiple host backends are enabled
    \begin{itemize} \item[] Previously, passing \texttt{Serial} execution space was ignored in favor of a default host parallel backend  \end{itemize}
    \item Using CUDA limits to set extents for blocks, grids in \texttt{MDRangePolicy}
    \begin{itemize} \item[] Previous, Kokkos internal tuning was potentially overextend in the \texttt{block.z} dimension \end{itemize}
    \item In \texttt{RangePolicy} construction, no longer require round-trip convertability between user provided \texttt{IndexType} and the internal \texttt{member\_type}
    \item Allow extracting host and device views from DualView with const value type
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Bug Fixes (3/3)}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Set an initial value index during reductions with \texttt{MinLoc}, \texttt{MaxLoc}, or \texttt{MinMaxLoc}
      \begin{itemize} \item[] Previously, invalid index could be given for location if view contain uniform values \end{itemize}
      \item Make \texttt{value\_type} for \texttt{RandomAccessIterator} non-\texttt{const} to match C++ standard
      \item Fix compilation error when using SYCL without architecture flags
      \begin{itemize} \item[] \texttt{KOKKOS\_ARCH\_INTEL\_GPU} was being assumed \end{itemize}
      \item Allow copy assign between \texttt{simd\_mask} with \texttt{KOKKOS\_ARCH\_AVX2=ON}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
